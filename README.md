# kinopio-client

<img src="./src/assets/logo-base.png" alt="logo" width="200">

Kinopio is a spatial thinking canvas for your new ideas and hard problems.

The `kinopio-client` is the client web app that users use to read and update spaces, cards, connections, etc. ‚Äì which is saved to localStorage and to the `kinopio-server` via API requests, queued API operations, and websocket broadcasts.

## Install

    git clone https://github.com/pketh/kinopio-client.git
    cd kinopio-client
    npm install
    npm install -g @vue/cli
    npm install -g hostile
    hostile set localhost kinopio.local

## Run

    npm run serve --host
    https://kinopio.local:8080

## Run with Production API Server

You can force the local app to use the prod API by editing `.env.local` so that `VITE_PROD_SERVER=true`. Create `env.local` by duplicating and renaming `.env.local.sample`.

When the app starts up, the `üê∏ kinopio-server URL` will be displayed in the browser logs.

## Linting

	npm run lint

Use the [Vue devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) for Firefox and Chrome. For Safari, uncomment code in `main.js` then,

	./node_modules/.bin/vue-devtools

| `store.js` | [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) store, contains global observables and methods needed by multiple components |
| `currentSpace.js` | Vuex store module that handles loading spaces
| `utils.js` | Functional methods that just do dom manipulations or common tasks. These can't access components or store directly |
| `views/Space.vue` | Contains the core interaction layer which sends user inputs to painting, connecting, dragging etc. components. Also where new connections are created and checked to see if they connect |

| `components/Box.vue` | Displays boxes from `store.state.currentBoxes`, and shows `ConnectionDetails` |
| `components/Header.vue` | Used for moving between spaces, searching/filter, shows user presence, changing user prefs, and Kinopio meta options. Shown on all routes |
| `components/layers/PaintSelectCanvas.vue` | The layers used for drawing the paint strokes for multiple card and connection selection which reveals `MultipleSelectedActions`, scroll locking on touch, and other `<canvas>` elements that need to cover the viewport |

| `components/NewBlankDialogTemplate.vue` | Template file for new dialog components |

## User States to Design For

| State | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| `offline` | indexedDB and API queue operations only |
| `not signed in` | indexedDB only |
| `space is read only` | cannot add cards or edit |
| `space is open` | can add cards, can only edit cards they created |
| `mobile` | touch handlers, no hover, small screen |
| `desktop zoom out` | using the zoom bar or cmd+/- |
| `pinch zoom out/in` | using native touch gesture on mobile |
| `group member or admin` | can see and edit all spaces in the group |

## Post Messages

Post messages are used to communicate with a parent `secureAppContext` environment, such as the iOS app that wraps the website in a child webview.

## How to update the 'Hello Kinopio' Space

The hello space serves as the entry point and marketing page for new users. It's generated within the app from `hello.json`.

To update it, create the space and export its json. Replace the contents of`hello.json` with the new json file.

## HTTPS Signing

> You shouldn't need to run this or update the cert until 2025, but just in case

To work with code that only works on https (e.g. clipboard copy and paste), [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) was used to create a local ssl certificate

    brew install mkcert
    mkcert -install
	mkcert -key-file ./.cert/key.pem -cert-file ./.cert/cert.pem "kinopio.local" "localhost" "127.0.0.1"

## Testing page-meta

`page-meta.js` is an [edge function](https://www.netlify.com/platform/core/functions/) that runs in an isolated server-side container before page requests. It writes `index.html` metatags for title, description etc. for crawlers.

I couldn't figure out how to run the netlify-cli locally, so instead I test this in staging using PR deploy URLs.
